1. If you test with "cargo test", the test will deliberately fail.

Instead, please test with "cargo test --release -- --nocapture".

There are two reasons for this:
A. Tests are too slow to run without release mode.
B. Without the -- --nocapture, the test crashes weirdly.  See comments at the test
   in pretty_trace/src/lib.rs.

2. The tests are only confirmed to work under linux.  They failed under OS X when tested.
